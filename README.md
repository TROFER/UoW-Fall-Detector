# UoW-Fall-Detector
This repository contains the code submitted for one of my Software Engineering modules (BS2203). The programs demonstrate the use of the MQTT protocol to provide a fall detection system for the elderly.

### What does this Project Exhibit?

* Use of Tk/Tcl for creating user Interfaces
* Use of SQL & SQLite for creating and storing patient data
* Use of the Paho MQTT client for lightweight M2M Communication

### Running the Code

1. Navigate to the "Code" folder using file explorer
2. Open up two command prompt sessions by typing "cmd" into the address bar
3. Open the client simulator by typing "python client.py"
4. Open the operator dashboard by typing "python dashboard.py"
